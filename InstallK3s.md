## Installing k3s

In this lab, we are going to install and configure k3s on a Raspaberry Pi

### Before we start the lab you need to have <a href="SLESonRPi.md">SLES 15 SP2 installed</a> on your Raspberry Pi.

We will begin this lab as the tux user on your Raspberry Pi

    ssh tux@x.x.x.x

#### Update to the latest patches
```
sudo zypper up
```
#### Install k3s via the automated script

We are using the --write-kubeconfig-mode 644 option so the .kube/config file is automaticly created
```
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - --write-kubeconfig-mode 644
```
The output will look simular to:

```

#### Test to see if it's working
```
k3s kubectl get nodes
```
Example:

```
NAME        STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
pi-erin-1   Ready    master   55s   v1.18.9+k3s1
```
## Install bash autocomplete for kubectl

    kubectl completion bash >/etc/bash_completion.d/kubectl
    source ~/.bashrc

## Install Helm3

### Install helm3 client

sudo wget -O helm.tar.gz https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.4.2-linux-arm64.tar.gz
tar -zxvf helm.tar.gz
